Feature: Completeness Policy

  Before closing, plan should fulfill demands
  What mean: amounts of product units should be at least equal to demands of customers for given day.
  Over-planning rounding up amounts to 1 full storage unit per day is acceptable.
  In other case, confirmation for each product is needed:
  confirm customer acceptance: „deliver part next day” (the remainder) or „adjust demand”.

  Plan Completeness takes into account:
  - parts amount currently planed in deliveries,
  - current demands expressed in parts amount,
  - the remainder (not fulfilled demands for product from last plan).
